## WHY NAME JAMADAAR?
Jamadaar, an Urdu word, is used for Sweepers/Cleaners in Pakistan. This Jamadaar will keep your cluster clean and sweep away the left overs of your cluster and will act as you want it to.

## Problem
Dangling/Redundant resources take a lot of space and memory in a cluster. So we want to delete these unneeded resources depending upon the age and pre-defined  annotations. e.g. I would like to delete namespaces that were without a specific annotation and are almost a month old and would like to take action whenever that happens.

## Solution

Jamadaar is a Kubernetes controller that can poll at configured time intervals and watch for dangling resources that are an 'X' time period old and don't have a specific annotation, and will delete them and take corresponding actions.

## Configuring

First of all you need to modify `configs/config.yaml` file. Following are the available options that you can use to customize Jamadaar:

| Key                   |Description                                                                    |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| polltimeinterval      | The time interval after which the controller will poll and look for dangling resources, The value can be in "ms", "s", "m", "h" or even combined like 2h45m       |
| age        | The time period that a dangling resource  has been created e.g. delete only resources that are 7 days old, The value can be in "d", "w", "m", "y", Combined format is not supported     |
| actions               | The Array of actions that you want to take, e.g. send message to Slack, etc   |

### Supported Resources
Currently we are supporting the following dangling resources,
- Namespaces


We will be adding support for other Resources as well in the future

### Supported Actions
Currently we are supporting following Actions with their Parameters,
- Default: No parameters needed, it will just log to console the details.
- Slack: you need to provide `token` and `Channel Name` as Parameters in the yaml file

We will be adding support for other Actions as well in the future
